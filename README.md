This project is a concept game combining multiplayer server-client game play, 3D rendering on the web, 
and a physics engine to create a test world that is walkable by players connecting on the web.

## Game Test Demo

Demo shows two players selecting a game to play on their web browsers. Once connected to the server, they both walk around, bump into each other, and look around at the pretty terrain.

## Debugging Console of the Demo

Demo shows the distributed server-client model. On the left is the Central Main server, on the right is the Game Server, which can be run on several instances around the world. We can see players connecting/disconnecting to the Game Server.
